# Front-end branch
Front-end made using server-side rendering with Nextjs and Reactjs using React hooks.

## Warning
Note that this branch cannot connect to server, so that means the front-end 
branch only can be used for UI and client interaction by itself. If you want to
test the server, merging the back with the front, you should go to the main branch in that case.
