# Front-end branch
Front-end made using server-side rendering with Nextjs and Reactjs using React hooks.

## Warning
Note that this branch cannot connect to the server, so that means the front-end 
branch only can be used for UI and client interaction by itself. If you want to
test the server, merging the back with the front, you should go to [MyFastTask](https://github.com/SGS-J/MyFastTask) repo to test it in this case.
